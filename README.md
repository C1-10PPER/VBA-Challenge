# VBA-Challenge
# There are three VBA modules.
# Please process in the following order:
# 1. Module1priceChange - Sets up the rows for Ticker, Quarterly Change, Percentage Change and Total Volume and then calculates and inputs the data.
# 2. Module2Format - Applies the formatting to the data that was previously extracted through the first module.
#3. Module3MarketMovers - Finds the Ticker with the Greatest % Increase, the Greatest % Decrease and the Greatest Volume. 

#Screenshots are provided for both alphabetical_testing spreadsheet and the Multiple_year_stock_data spreadsheet.
#VBA Code was processed for alphabetical_testing but left unprocessed for the Multiple_year_stock_data. 

#Added the seperate individual VBA script files after Thursdays Class.
